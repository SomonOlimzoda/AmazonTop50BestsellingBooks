## Amazon Top 50 Bestselling Books from 2009-19

### Introduction

In this project, I will try to answer interesting questions. To do that I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: **ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.**

## Ask

Based on the data we can derive many answers. Specifically, I want to know how these genres (Fiction and Non-Fiction) differ from each other:

1. Which genre has the most books in this category?
2. How do user ratings differ for each genre?
3. How does price differ for Fiction and Non-Fiction books?

**You can find answers to many questions in SQL script**

## Prepare

Data has been scraped from Kaggle and it contains data of Amazon's Top 50 Bestselling Books between 2009 - 2019. The data contains 550 bookshas which categorized into Fiction and Non Fiction using Goodreads.  

The data has been made available by Amazon and Goodreads website under this license [CC0: Public Domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). This is public data that you can download and use to explore your questions.

If there are issues with bias or credibility in this data it will be not considered ROCCC data. ROCCC means your data:

**Reliable**, **Original**, **Comprehensive**, **Current**, **Cited**

I checked the data and there are no issues with bias or credibility.

## Process

In this step, I choose a tool to work with. Before moving to analyze step I ensures that the data is cleaned and ready to analyze.

Since the data is clean and compact, I will be using DBeaver is a SQL client software application and a database administration tool.

## Analyze

Different analysis were carried out to perform calculations, identify trends and relationships using SQL queries in DBeaver. You can view my SQL file used for analysis and insights [here](https://github.com/SomonOlimzoda/AmazonTop50BestsellingBooks/blob/main/SQL%20script.sql)

Further analysis were carried out to perform calculations, identify trends and relationships using PivotTable and Charts in Excel. You can view my Excel file used for visualizations and insights [here](https://github.com/SomonOlimzoda/AmazonTop50BestsellingBooks/blob/main/Amazon%20bestselling%20books%202009-19_v1.xlsx)

## Share

Now that I have performed required analysis and gained few insights from data, where I am going to create compelling visualizations. As a tool I would like to choose to use Tableau. Tableau is one of the leading data visualization tool used for data analysis and business intelligence helps to create different charts and graphs, in addition to visualizing data through reports and dashboards in Tableau to derive meaningful insights.
