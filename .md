## Amazon Top 50 Bestselling Books

### Introduction

In this project, I will try to answer the key business questions. In order to do that I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: **ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.**

## Ask

Based on the data we have downloaded we can derive many answers. One of the key questions can be how Non Fiction differs from Fiction.

**Guiding Questions**

How do User Ratings differ for Fiction and Non Fiction?
How does price differ for Fiction and Non Fiction?

## Prepare

Data has been scraped from Kaggle and it contains data of Amazon's Top 50 Bestselling Books between 2009 - 2019. The data contains 550 bookshas which categorized into Fiction and Non Fiction using Goodreads.  

The data has been made available by Amazon and Goodreads website under this license [CC0: Public Domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). This is a public data that you can download and use to explore your own questions.

If there are issues with bias or credibility in this data it won't be considered ROCCC data. ROCCC means your data:

**Reliable**

**Original**

**Comprehensive**

**Current**

**Cited**

I checked data and there are no issues with bias or credibility.

## Process

In this step, we are going to work on the data using correct tools.

This step ensures that the data is cleaned and transformed for analysis.

Since the data is clean and compact, we will be using R to run quick analysis and summarize our findings using visualizations.

We will load the data first using tidyverse package of R.


## Analyze

Now the data is clean and formatted, we can run descriptive analysis on it which includes finding mean, median.

We will be summarising User Rating, Price and Reviews across the entire dataset and later on we will comparing it with sub-groups of Fiction and Non Fiction.
