## Amazon Top 50 Bestselling Books from 2009-19

### Introduction

In this project, I will try to answer interesting questions. To do that I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: **ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.**

## Ask

Based on the data we can derive many answers. Specifically, I want to know how these genres (Fiction and Non-Fiction) differ from each other:

1. Which genre has the most books in this category?
2. How do user ratings differ for each genre?
3. How does price differ for Fiction and Non-Fiction books?
4. Which genres have the highest and lowest ratings?

**You will find all the answers to these questions in SQL and R scripts.**

## Prepare

Data has been scraped from Kaggle and it contains data of Amazon's Top 50 Bestselling Books between 2009 - 2019. The data contains 550 bookshas which categorized into Fiction and Non Fiction using Goodreads.  

The data has been made available by Amazon and Goodreads website under this license [CC0: Public Domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). This is a public data that you can download and use to explore your own questions.

If there are issues with bias or credibility in this data it will be not considered ROCCC data. ROCCC means your data:

**Reliable**, **Original**, **Comprehensive**, **Current**, **Cited**

I checked data and there are no issues with bias or credibility.

## Process

In this step, I choose a tool to work with. Before moving to analyze step I ensures that the data is cleaned and ready to analyze.

Since the data is clean and compact, I will be using DBeaver is a SQL client software application and a database administration tool. Also, I will use R to run quick analysis and summarize our findings using visualizations.

## Analyze

Now the data is clean and formatted, we can run descriptive analysis on it which includes finding mean, median.

We will be summarising User Rating, Price and Reviews across the entire dataset and later on we will comparing it with sub-groups of Fiction and Non Fiction.
